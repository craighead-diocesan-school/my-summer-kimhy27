<h1>Summer</h1> 

<h2>Summer 2022/23 in Korea</h2> 

<p>This summer I went to Korea to visit family.
 I had a really good time seeing family and friends that I couldn't see for years. 
 I ate so much food and got a lot of money for new years. I want to go back already.</p>

What I did:

<ul>
<li>Hang out with friends in Korea</li>
<li>went shopping</li>
<li>Saw Enhypen</li>
</ul>
